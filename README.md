Here you can find the source code for the commute flow project.

Here at the SPA-lab at the University of Manchester we have developed a two-tier geodemographic typology of commuting patterns with 9 super-groups and a total of 40 groups. For each classification there is a pen portrait containing a statistical description with a radial chart and flow map.

**www.commute-flow.net** provides an online interactive map and associated data analytics for the two-tier geodemographic typology of the 2001 Census for England and Wales.
